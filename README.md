### MongoDB Tutorial and best practices

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. This database is able to handle huge volumes of data very efficiently. MongoDB does not have restriction on schema design. Unlike traditional relation database, where data is stored in clearly defined tables and columns, and each column contains a very specific type of data. MongoDB has a dynamic schemas for unstructured data. 

- Data can be stored as a (i) KeyValue, (ii) document-oriented, (iii)column-oriented, or (iv) graph-based.
